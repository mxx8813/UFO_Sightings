# UFO_Sightings

## Overview:
For this project, we will build an web app using Javascript, HTML & CSS to allow our users to retrieve and filter UFO sighting data throughoutthe US based on filter criteria set available to them.

## Results:

Once an user open the web app, they will see the following page.

In the top section, we included an introduction and quotations from W. Avy, a UFO-entuiast and amateur ufologist to set the context.

As you scroll down the web page, the user will see a *Filter Search* section on the left hand side of the page to filter sighing data by: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape as noted in each sighting documentation.  The user can apply one or more filters and the table will dynamically apply based on filter criteria!

The search below represents all sightings that happend on **1/6/2010**.

## Summary:

While the filter search is a great way for users to narrow down to specific sightings that match their criteria, they are not able to multiple select cities, or enter a range of date, therefore somewhat limiting the search UX.

In summary, we can further enhance the user experience by:
1. Ability to filter by data range
2. Ability to multi-select city, state, country, shape
